# About My Nepal Trek

In partnership with BuildOn, I embarked on a transformative journey to Nepal to help construct a school for a local community. This experience was not just about building a physical structure, but about creating lasting connections and understanding the power of education in transforming lives.

## The Mission

BuildOn's mission is to break the cycle of poverty, illiteracy, and low expectations through service and education. Through their Trek program, volunteers work alongside local community members to build schools in some of the economically poorest countries in the world.

## The Journey

This blog documents my personal experiences:
- Working with the local community
- Understanding Nepalese culture
- The challenges and triumphs of school construction
- Personal reflections and growth
